            <p class="subtitle">Ph.D. Student, Michigan Technological University</p>
            
            <p>Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at Michigan Technological University, where I specialize in robotics, controls, and reinforcement learning. I work in research focusing on comparative studies of Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) controllers for quadrupedal robots, trying to teach robots how to walk, run, and not fall over (too often).</p>

            <p>My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and robotic control systems â€” basically, if it moves and learns, I want to study it. When I'm not debugging why my simulation turned into a somersaulting robot, you'll probably find me working on PLC programming, industrial automation, or developing autonomous navigation systems.</p>

            <p>I started my journey with a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering in India, followed by an M.S. in Mechatronics at Michigan Tech. I've worked on projects ranging from industrial assembly line automation to developing end effectors for fruit harvesting robots, and now I'm diving headfirst into making robots move more like humans (or at least like caffeinated humans).</p>

            <p>Whether it's a robot learning to walk, optimizing control algorithms, or working on the next breakthrough in autonomous systems â€” I'm all in for the learning, the challenges, and the occasional victory when everything works as intended. Let's connect if you're into robotics, automation, controls, or just want to discuss the latest developments in making machines smarter. ðŸ¤–</p>
