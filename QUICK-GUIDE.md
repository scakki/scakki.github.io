# Website Organization - Quick Guide

## 🎯 Problem Solved!

Your website pages were empty because of **CORS restrictions** - browsers block loading local files via JavaScript for security reasons. 

## 📁 What I've Done

### ✅ **Working Solution (Current)**
- `index.html` - **Working version** with all content embedded but organized
- Content is still modular in the HTML but works locally without a server
- Clean navigation and theme switching works perfectly

### 📊 **File Structure Created**
```
your-website/
├── index.html                    ← CURRENT WORKING FILE
├── index-dynamic-backup.html     ← Previous dynamic version (backup)
├── index-embedded.html           ← Source for current working version
├── css/styles.css               ← All your styles (organized!)
├── js/script.js                 ← Navigation & theme toggle
├── js/page-loader.js            ← Dynamic loading (for server use)
├── pages/                       ← Individual page files (for development)
│   ├── home.html
│   ├── publications.html
│   ├── projects.html
│   ├── experience.html
│   └── skills.html
└── config/site-config.json      ← Site configuration
```

## 📝 How to Update Content

3. This keeps your changes organized

### 🔧 **Option 3: Use Dynamic Loading (Advanced)**
If you want to use the dynamic loading system:
1. Start a local web server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
2. Use `index-dynamic-backup.html` as your main file
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

2. Copy an existing `project-item` div
3. Update the content with your new project details

### Update Contact Info
1. Find the `contact-info` section in the home page
2. Update email, phone, LinkedIn, etc.
